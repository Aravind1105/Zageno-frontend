# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies required to run the application.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

Once the application loads, you will see the home page with existing lists(if there are any) along with Add button to create new list.

If you create a new list, it is navigated to that list where you will have an option to add your own items into the cart.

Also, you can perform multiple operations like add/update/delete items.

Here, you can simulate the multiple users by opening multiple tabs to access the same shopping list.
